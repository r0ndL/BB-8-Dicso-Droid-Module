Disco-Droid

#Introduction
The Disco Droid is an Arduino based module that will mainly provide Visual and Audio Effect for BB-8â€™s Dome. In order to create visual effects on the dome, more pins were needed that what an ordinary Arduino can provide, as such there was a need to create a module that has integrated output expander in order to accommodate the needs of the dome, and a few more extras for future upgrades. 
The Disco-Droid is capable working alone, or remotely controlled by another Bluetooth 4.0 LE device, it has a total of 32 12-bit PWM outputs, 7 spare analog pins from the Arduino, and 3 Digital I/O pins also from the Arduino, the Module has also integrated a MP3 Playback module that can drive a single 3W speaker. 

Most of all the different parts that was selected for this module has taken into account that many builders wish to make their domes as light as possible, in order to do so the Disco-Droid was design with the smallest off-the-shelf parts and modules in order to conserve on weight and size. The dimensions of the circuit board is just 2 x 3.5 x .7 inches, just slightly longer than your credit card.

#Roadmap
**V1.0.6 - Current Final Board Design for Version 1**
**Hardware Features**
- 32 PWM Output (Can handle Motors, LEDs, and Servos, etc..)
- 7 Analog Inputs (Can also be used for Digital Outputs)
- 3 Digital Outputs/Inputs
- 3W Speaker Output
- Bluetooth Ready
- Software Features
- Randomized Sound file playing
- 3 Pre-set Visualizer patterns 
- Small compact Code (using only 14% of the Arduino's memory, and 12% buffer memory)

**V1.1.6 - Same Board Design Utilizing Bluetooth remote connectivity**
**Hardware Features**
- Same as V1.0.6
- Software Features
- When left alone, it will follow V1.0.6 program functions
- Bluetooth Feature will be utilized to trigger the Dome light pattern changes, and sounds.

>In order to utilize V1.1.6 features a future Bluetooth Remote will be released to compliment the Disco-Droid Module.
